# Implementation Tasks: Frontend Application & Integration

**Feature ID:** 3-frontend-app-integration
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** Ready for Implementation
**Created:** 2026-02-04
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-04

---

## Overview

This document provides a complete, dependency-ordered task list for implementing the Frontend Application & Integration feature. Tasks are organized by user story from the specification to enable independent implementation and testing of each feature increment.

**Total Tasks:** 85
**User Stories:** 8
**Estimated Complexity:** High
**Dependencies:** Features 1 (Authentication) and 2 (Backend Task API) must be operational

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP Scope
**Minimum Viable Product includes User Stories 1-4:**
- US1: New User Registration
- US2: Existing User Login
- US3: View Task List
- US4: Create New Task

This provides complete authentication flow and basic task management capability.

### Incremental Delivery
After MVP, implement remaining user stories in priority order:
- US5: Edit Task
- US6: Delete Task
- US7: Toggle Task Completion
- US8: User Logout

### Parallel Execution Opportunities
Tasks marked with [P] can be executed in parallel with other [P] tasks in the same phase, as they operate on different files with no dependencies.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### User Story Dependencies

```
Setup (Phase 1)
    ↓
Foundational (Phase 2)
    ↓
    ├─→ US1: New User Registration (Phase 3) ← P1 Critical
    ├─→ US2: Existing User Login (Phase 4) ← P1 Critical
    │
    └─→ US3: View Task List (Phase 5) ← P2 High (depends on US1 or US2)
            ↓
            ├─→ US4: Create New Task (Phase 6) ← P2 High
            ├─→ US5: Edit Task (Phase 7) ← P3 Medium
            ├─→ US6: Delete Task (Phase 8) ← P3 Medium
            ├─→ US7: Toggle Completion (Phase 9) ← P3 Medium
            └─→ US8: User Logout (Phase 10) ← P2 High
                    ↓
                    └─→ Polish (Phase 11) ← Final phase
```

### Critical Path
1. **Phase 1 (Setup)** → MUST complete first - establishes project structure
2. **Phase 2 (Foundational)** → MUST complete before user stories - provides core infrastructure
3. **Phases 3-4 (US1-US2)** → Can be done in parallel - both are authentication flows
4. **Phase 5 (US3)** → Depends on authentication (US1 or US2) - displays tasks
5. **Phases 6-10 (US4-US8)** → Can be done in parallel after Phase 5 - all task operations
6. **Phase 11 (Polish)** → MUST complete last - enhances all features

### Parallel Execution Examples

**Phase 1 Parallel Tasks:**
```bash
# Can execute simultaneously (different files, no dependencies)
T004, T005, T006, T007, T008, T009
```

**Phase 2 Parallel Tasks:**
```bash
# Can execute simultaneously (different UI components)
T020, T021, T022, T023, T024
```

**User Stories Parallel Execution:**
```bash
# After Phase 2 completes, can execute in parallel:
Phase 3 (US1: Registration) + Phase 4 (US2: Login)

# After Phase 5 completes, can execute in parallel:
Phase 6 (US4: Create) + Phase 7 (US5: Edit) + Phase 8 (US6: Delete) + Phase 9 (US7: Toggle) + Phase 10 (US8: Logout)
```

**Phase 11 Parallel Tasks:**
```bash
# Can execute simultaneously (different concerns)
T096, T097, T098, T099, T100, T101, T102, T103
```
